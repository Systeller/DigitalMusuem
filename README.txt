The controls are a bit clunky, but stay with me

I/i create a new picture
E edit current picture you are looking at
T move picture you are looking at (pressing t again will make it stop)
R by holding it, and moving left to right will make the painting turn around
Y by holding it, change the scale of the painting by going back and forward ( very slowly)
